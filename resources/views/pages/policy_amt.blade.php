                            potential Money Laundering/Terrorist Financing (ML/TF) risks associated with specific customers
                            and transactions in order to ensure focused monitoring of t hose customers and transactions that

                            Asset Matrix MFB adopts a risk-based approach that is commensurate with the specific risks of
                            money laundering and terrorism financing. Higher money laundering risks demand stronger
                            controls. However, all risks, whether low, medium or high, must be mitigated by the application
                            of necessary controls such as the implementation of appropriate customer due diligence,
                            verification and monitoring procedures that are proportionate to the identified ML/FT risks that
                            the financial institution is exposed to from its customers, products and countries that it
                            transacts business with.
